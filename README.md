# Prework - *Background Color Changer*

Submitted by: **Ramatoulaye Bah**

**BCC** is an app that allows the user, by clicking a button, to change the background of the app to a random color.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

List of some of my favorite applications:
- YouTube: Ability to speed up/slow down the play and getting video suggestions related to what I just watched 
- WhatsApp: Disappearing messages, creating and sending stickers, sending circular video messages
- Spotify: Shuffle feature, Spotify wrap and playlists created for you based on frequently listened to songs
- Flora - Green Focus: Combines a Pomodoro timer with a tree-planting game to help reduce phone usage, satisfaction of receiving a reward

Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

I'd like to build an app focused on language learning. Similarly to Duolingo, I want the app to have a free version to democratize education. It would have features like interacting with other learners / an AI virtual professor to ensure immersion and accurate representation. I want to focus on endangered languages and making sure cultures are taught alongside the language. It could also be similar to a dating app but to learn a language. Users can swipe left or right to find a match adequate for their language learning goals and level.


## Notes

I had some chanllenges finding the location of specific files and settings. Now, I know my way better around Xcode.
